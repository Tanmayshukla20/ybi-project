# ybi-project
My project for 1 month summer internship ybi foundation to predict analytics of stock market

here is an overview of how I created a python code to analyse the stock market and make predictions about the tentative trends:

Downloads historical stock prices using yfinance.
Shifts the close prices forward to simulate future prediction.
Trains a Linear Regression model on past data.
Predicts the next 30 days of stock prices.
Plots both the actual and predicted prices.
